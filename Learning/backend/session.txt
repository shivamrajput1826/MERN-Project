Session->
we give a cookie and with the help of cookie we can find which user to show and which
not.
in the main.ts
we have added middlerware
app.use(
    cookieSession({
      keys: ['asdfas'],
    }),
  );
 This will help in the addition of session cookie..
 Now we added encrypted userId in the session object and then in the signout we 
 have given null to make sure the session cookie is finished.

 Guard-> Reject request to certain handlers if the user is not signed in
 Interceptor+Decorator -> Automatically tell a handlerr who the currently signed in user is
